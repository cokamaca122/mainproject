      <div class="pillar-title">
       Systematic &amp; Rigorous
      </div>
      <div class="pillar-text">
       Qualitative research should be systematically and rigorously conducted. There are no excuses for a casual or ad hoc approach to qualitative research. Researchers should think, plan and act in systematic and rigorous ways in the research process. This should, however, be distinguished from a rigid or structured approach, which is usually not appropriate for qualitative research.

      <div class="pillar-title">
       Accountability
      </div>
      <div class="pillar-text">
       Qualitative research should be accountable for its quality and its claims. In other words, it should not attempt to position itself beyond judgment, and should provide its audience with material upon which they can judge it.
      </div>
     </li>
     <li>
      <div class="pillar-title">
       Strategic &amp; Flexible
      </div>
      <div class="pillar-text">
       Qualitative research should be strategically conducted, yet flexible and contextual. Essentially, this means that qualitative researchers should make decisions on the basis not only of a sound research strategy, but also of a sensitivity to the changing contexts and situations in which the research takes place.
      </div>
     </li>
     <li>
      <div class="pillar-title">
       Critical Reflexivity
      </div>
      <div class="pillar-text">
       Qualitative research should involve critical self-scrutiny by the researcher, or active reflexivity. This means that researchers should constantly take stock of their actions and their role in the research process, and subject these to the same critical scrutiny as the rest of their ‘data’. This is based on the belief that a researcher cannot be neutral, or objective, or detached, from the knowledge and evidence they are generating. Instead, they should seek to understand their role in that process. Indeed, the very act of asking oneself difficult questions in the research process is part of the activity or reflexivity.
      </div>
     </li>
     <li>
      <div class="pillar-title">
       Explanatory Arguments
      </div>
      <div class="pillar-text">
       Qualitative research should produce explanations or arguments, rather than claiming to offer mere descriptions. All qualitative research should be formulated around an intellectual puzzle - that is, something which the researcher wishes to explain. It is not sufficient for a researcher to say that they wish simply to describe something, or explore what is happening. Descriptions and explorations involve selective viewing and interpretation; they cannot be neutral, objective or total. The elements which a researcher chooses to see as relevant for a description or exploration will be based, implicitly or explicitly, on a way of seeing the social world, and on a particular form of explanatory logic. Qualitative researchers recognize that they are producing arguments, and are explicit about the logic on which these are based.
      </div>
     </li>
     <li>
      <div class="pillar-title">
       Generalizability
      </div>
      <div class="pillar-text">
       Qualitative research should produce explanations or arguments which are generalizable in some way, or have some demonstrable wider resonance. Qualitative research should not be satisfied with producing explanations which are idiosyncratic or particular only to the limited empirical parameters of their study, not least because this is to underplay the great capacity of qualitative methods to facilitate cross-contextual generalities mentioned earlier. Similarly, presenting data but leaving questions about its generality or wider applicability for the audience to decide is not a very honest or satisfactory strategy. It implies that the researcher has no authorial presence, and that data are raw commodities, neither of which claim bears much close scrutiny. The challenges posed by generalizing from qualitative—or indeed any—research should not be underestimated, however.

     <li>
      <div class="pillar-title">
       Methodological Nuance
      </div>
      <div class="pillar-text">
       Qualitative research should not be seen as a unified body of philosophy and practice, whose methods can simply be combined unproblematically. Similarly, qualitative research should not be seen as necessarily in opposition to, or antithetical to, quantitative research. The distinction between quantitative and qualitative methods is not entirely clear-cut, and all researchers should think very carefully about how and why they might combine any methods, whether qualitative, quantitative, or both.

     <li>
      <div class="pillar-title">
       Moral &amp; Political Practice
      </div>
      <div class="pillar-text">
       Qualitative research should be conducted as a moral practice, and with regard to its political context. Many of the specific moral and political dilemmas raised by qualitative research are examined in various discussions.
